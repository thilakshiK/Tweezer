This is an application to visualize emotions taken from tweets which can be accessed through the web. User needs to simply type a keyword into the input field and click Search button. Six types of emotions are visualized in this project which are anger, fear, joy, sadness, disgust & surprise. Recent Tweets containing the keyword are pulled from the Twitter and visualized in different ways in each tab at the top of the window. These tabs are “Tweets”, “Map”, “Timeline” & “Pie Chart”.
